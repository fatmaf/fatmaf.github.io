[About](#intro)|[Projects](#projects)|[Awards](#awards)


My advisers are [Dr. Dave Parker](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~parkerdx/), [Dr. Nick Hawes](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~nah/) and [Dr. Tim Miller (University of Melbourne)](http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tmiller/).I also work with [Dr. Bruno Lacerda](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~lacerdab/). I am supported by the Priestly Scholarship.

My research focus is on multi robot planning utilizing formal methods. I am also part of the [Intelligent Robotics Lab](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/robotics/).

I have an MSc. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University where I was part of the [CORAL lab](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~coral/) under [Dr. Manuela Veloso](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/). I have a B.E in Computer Engineering from the [National University of Science and Technology (NUST)](http://www.nust.edu.pk/), Pakistan. After my masters I worked as a lecturer at NUST, teaching undergraduates introduction to programming. Before my masters I worked as a software developer at [LMKR](http://www.lmkr.com/) which is an oil and gas software compnany.



## Projects

 

#### When to Coordinate - Learning Sparse State Interactions in Multi Robot Policies 
For my masters' thesis I implemented a two layer Q-learning algorithm for Sparse Interaction MDPs and abstracted it to 3D space for the manipulation robot Baxter.(Here are videos of generated policies [Video1](https://youtu.be/p9YSnN4lDnU), [Video2](https://youtu.be/8dhZOKPGXhg)) 


#### Robot Safety

During my masters I also implementing a provably safe version of the the Dynamic Window Approach for obstacle avoidance using ROS.(Here are videos of a very basic setup on a robot [Video1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h2zbbh5naey2nx4/collision_avoidance_1.mpg?dl=0),[Video2)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wcftb3phi9sg3o7/collision_avoidance_2.mpg?dl=0) 
 
#### Playing Tetris

For the adaptive control and reinforcement learning course we implemented a policy improvement algorithm that learned to play tetris. ([Video](https://youtu.be/1gfuKh12VHk?list=PLX0RbIkD2pkdg0f6sHgaoMZCwg02sR_j2))
 

#### Gesture Recognition using MEMS

For my undergrad final year project, my groupmate and I implemented a proof of concept for gesture recognition using wireless sensor network and Hidden Markov Models.([Link to our project presentation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/40uldztp7d081ka/FatmaFaruq_ActivityRecognition.pdf?dl=0))

## Misc

During my bachelors, my team and I designed and fabricated an autonomous robot that could line track and place pegs in stands for a national competition.For the Systems Engineering course in my masters, I was part of a team that made an exhibit which was deployed in the Pittsburgh Children's Museum for 3 days where kids could race dummy robot cars.

I'm also interested in teaching kids robotics and was part of CMU-Scitech where we taught middle schoolers arduino and scratch programming. As a lecturer at NUST, I organized and conducted workshops on Lego Robot Programming for school children and was also part of the Theme Committee for the National Engineering Robotics Contest.

#### Just things I'd like to list

1.  [Patari](patari.pk) is the "Spotify" for Pakistani Music with some really great playlists - political and sufi.
2.  [Code for Pakistan](http://codeforpakistan.org/) among other inspiration initiatives making tech inspired solutions possible.
