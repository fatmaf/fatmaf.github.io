            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p> I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Manchester in the <a href="https://autonomy-and-verification.github.io/">Autonomy and Verification Group</a>.
                I work with <a href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/michael.fisher/">Michael Fisher</a>, <a href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/louise.dennis/">Louise Dennis</a> and <a href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/clare.dixon/">Clare Dixon</a>. My current focus is runtime verification of robots. I am also involved with the Trustworthy Autonomonous Systems Hub's <a href="https://verifiability.org"> Verifiability Node</a>.
    </p>
    <section id="education">
        <h2> Experience </h2>
    <p>I have been awarded a PhD jointly by the University of Birmingham and University of Melbourne.
        My PhD studies were supported by the Priestly Scholarship which is a joint degree program between the two universities.
        My PhD thesis was titled <i>Verified multi-robot planning under uncertainty</i>. My wonderful advisers were
        <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~parkerdx/"> Dr. Dave Parker</a>,
        <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~nah/">Dr. Nick Hawes</a> and 
        <a href="http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tmiller/">Dr. Tim Miller (University of Melbourne)</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~lacerdab/">Dr. Bruno Lacerda</a>. 
       
   My research focus was multi robot planning utilizing formal methods. 
        I was also part of the <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/groupings/robotics/">Intelligent Robotics Lab</a>. 
    </p>
    <p> I have an MSc. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University where I was part of the 
        <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~coral/">CORAL lab</a> under 
        <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/">Dr. Manuela Veloso</a>. 
        I have a  B.E in Computer Engineering from the 
        <a href="http://www.nust.edu.pk/">National University of Science and Technology (NUST)</a>, 
        Pakistan. After my masters I worked as a lecturer at NUST, teaching undergraduates introduction to programming. 
        Before my masters I worked as a software developer at
        <a href="http://www.lmkr.com/">LMKR</a> which is an oil and gas software compnany.</p> </section>

            <h4>Verified multi-robot planning under uncertainty</h4> My PhD work investigated task allocation and planning robust to robot failure with a quantitative guarantee on the expected number of tasks completed by the team. I looked at three different algorithms for task allocation and planning, incorporating task reallocation when a robot failed.</td>

<h4>When to Coordinate - Learning Sparse State Interactions in Multi Robot Policies</h4> For my masters' thesis I implemented a two layer Q-learning algorithm for Sparse Interaction MDPs and abstracted it to 3D space for the manipulation robot Baxter.(Here are videos of generated policies <a href="https://youtu.be/p9YSnN4lDnU" target="_blank">Video1</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/8dhZOKPGXhg" target="_blank">Video2</a>)</td>

<section id="misc"><h2>Misc</h2>During my bachelors, my team and I designed and fabricated an autonomous robot that could line track and place pegs in stands for a national competition.For the Systems Engineering course in my masters, I was part of a team that made an exhibit which was deployed in the Pittsburgh Children's Museum for 3 days where kids could race dummy robot cars. <p> I'm also interested in teaching kids robotics and was part of CMU-Scitech where we taught middle schoolers arduino and scratch programming. As a lecturer at NUST, I organized and conducted workshops on Lego Robot Programming for school children and was also part of the Theme Committee for the National Engineering Robotics Contest.</p>

  <h4>Robot Simulator</h4>For our computer graphics course in my undergrad, my teammates and I implemented a robot simulator using OpenGL and C++ which allowed the user to build a crude robot chassis in 3-D, place sensoros, input a line track and see how the robot did. The project was very close to my heart and a lot of fun particularly because we were competing in an actual robotics compeition as well!
