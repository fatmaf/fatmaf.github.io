<h4>When to Coordinate - Learning Sparse State Interactions in Multi Robot Policies</h4> For my masters' thesis I implemented a two layer Q-learning algorithm for Sparse Interaction MDPs and abstracted it to 3D space for the manipulation robot Baxter.(Here are videos of generated policies <a href="https://youtu.be/p9YSnN4lDnU" target="_blank">Video1</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/8dhZOKPGXhg" target="_blank">Video2</a>)</td>

<section id="misc"><h2>Misc</h2>During my bachelors, my team and I designed and fabricated an autonomous robot that could line track and place pegs in stands for a national competition.For the Systems Engineering course in my masters, I was part of a team that made an exhibit which was deployed in the Pittsburgh Children's Museum for 3 days where kids could race dummy robot cars. <p> I'm also interested in teaching kids robotics and was part of CMU-Scitech where we taught middle schoolers arduino and scratch programming. As a lecturer at NUST, I organized and conducted workshops on Lego Robot Programming for school children and was also part of the Theme Committee for the National Engineering Robotics Contest.</p>

  <h4>Robot Simulator</h4>For our computer graphics course in my undergrad, my teammates and I implemented a robot simulator using OpenGL and C++ which allowed the user to build a crude robot chassis in 3-D, place sensoros, input a line track and see how the robot did. The project was very close to my heart and a lot of fun particularly because we were competing in an actual robotics compeition as well!
